2. Add the javascript include to your application layout (views/layouts/application.html.erb perhaps?)

   <%=javascript_include_tag 'colour_picker'%>
   
3. Add it to a form:


   <%form_for :post do |f|%>
      <%=colour_picker :post, :colour_code%>
   <%end%>

<%=colour_picker object, method, options = {}, button_options = {}%>
